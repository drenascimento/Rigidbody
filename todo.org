* Create rigidbody tab in Scotty3D menu using ImGUI
- Figure out how to register tab.
- Add a "simulate" button.
- Figure out how to get all meshes in the scene.

* Single-threaded simulation
** Create rigid body class.
- Constructor to build from model/mesh?
- Two main variables. Position and quaternion.
- Should contain inertia tensor matrix, velocity vector, angular velocity vector, ...
- Contains some origin point. Should it be the center of mass? (probably not)
- Contains a group of particles representing its collision mesh.

** Create particle class.
- Add all physical properties.
- Have some notion of location with regards to owning rigid body origin.

** Grid of particles
- 4D grid, where 3 dimensions are for space and 4th for storing particles in the same location.
- Make 4th dimension adjustable.
- Side length of a voxel = diameter of particle. Perhaps we want to enforce uniform particle sizes across a simulation? (for sure)

** Simulation step
- Take all rigid bodies in the scene and update all their particles:
  + Particle position
  + Particle velocity
  + Particle relative position to center of mass.
- Create grid and store all particles. Should we just update grid or should we create a new one every time? What are the merits of each approach?
- Over all pairs of colliding particles, calculate particle forces:
  + Repulsive force
  + Damping force
  + Shear force
- Aggregate over all forces to compute linear and angular momenta of rigid body.


* Tasks
- Import ~Scene_Rigidbody~ into scene.
